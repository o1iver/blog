Welcome to the real world
=========================

**How different is studying and working? Well I am about to find out.**

About three weeks ago I got an offer to do a three month internship at ABB in Baden Switzerland and today is my first day!

I am excited, to say the least. After setting three alarms last night I still couldn.t sleep well, waking up several times to check if it wasn.t already too late. I even woke up after dreaming that I had sleept the whole day and it was already Wednesday.

Thankfully I did wake up at 6.40, albeit quite tired. Then the real fun started: what the hell am I going to wear? I usually couldn.t care less, as people who have seen me in lectures wearing a tracksuit and flip-flops will tell you, but today I ended up trying three different sweaters and even a shirt. In the end I kept it simple, opting for jeans and a t-shirt. Hopefully that isn.t going to backfire. My mum said I should wear slacks and a shirt, but firstly they aren.t as comfortable and secondly I am going to be working as a (wannabe)-engineer and as such hidden somewhere deep inside, miles from any customers.

Now I am sitting in the train, about to arrive 30 minutes early and psyched as hell. This is after all the first time I will be doing meaningful paid work for a big company and also the first time I will be making enough money to support myself (and that is a great feeling)!

Let.s see how this goes :-)

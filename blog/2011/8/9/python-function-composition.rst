Python: Function Composition
============================

If you know basic mathematics function composition will seem like a very simple and obvious thing. You are applying one function and then applying that function's result to another function. 

*Note: for this to work the return value(s) of the inner function must match the input expected by the outer function.*

The ability to compose functions is used mostly in functional programming languages (it is even one of the main points of Monads).

So how do you compose functions in Python? Well I think there is actually a built-in compose function, but I thought I would build one myself.

Composing two functions:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def comp2(f1,f2):
        return lambda *args, **kwargs: f1(f2(*args,**kwargs))

Composing many functions:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def comp(*funcs):
        if len(funcs) in (0,1):
            raise ValueError('need at least two functions to compose')
        # reverse funcs
        funcs = funcs[::-1]

    # list of composed functions (to avoid recursion problems)
    composed = []

    # add last function
    composed.append(funcs[0])

    # we cannot use a for func in funcs here because of scope
    # problems (will recurse infinitely)
    i = 1
    while i <= len(funcs) - 1:
        composed.append(comp2(funcs[i],composed[-1]))
        i += 1

    return composed[-1]

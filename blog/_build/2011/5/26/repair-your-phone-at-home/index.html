<p>I bought a Galaxy S a few months ago and for some reason it just stopped working some day. I took it to the mobile provider I bought it from and they sent it for repair. In the shop the sales guy opened the back of the phone and said it looked like there was alcohol in there. I couldn.t remember any getting in there, but what do I know. He told me that it was unlikely that it would fall under warranty.</p>
<p>Anyways a few weeks later I got a letter back saying: phone is broken and the damage not covered by warranty. Your choices are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Get it fixed for about 260 Swiss Francs (don.t remember exactly)</li>
<li>Forget about it (they will recycle it)</li>
<li>Get it sent back (will cost 45 Francs)</li>
</ol>
<p>The last option was the default choice and I forgot to reply in time (although 10 days is a bit short, in my opinion) to say that they should just recycle it. So I got it back and had to pay 45 Francs.</p>
<p>So today it was just lying on my desk. I was skyping with my wonderful girlfriend (<strong>wink</strong>) and something clicked in my head as I glanced over and saw a screwdriver next to the phone. Curiosity kicked in and I disassembled the phone, removing all the parts (fun experience). Then I realized that yes, this is interesting, but what am I now going to do with all these parts. Thus I put everything back together.</p>
<p>I couldn.t believe my eyes when holding down the power button it started up normally again.</p>
<p>So, after saving about 260 bucks and having a nice look at the insides of the Galaxy S I now have my phone back!</p>

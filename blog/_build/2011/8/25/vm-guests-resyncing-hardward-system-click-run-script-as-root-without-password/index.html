  <h1 class="title">VM guests: re-syncing hardware-/system clock (run sync script as root without password)</h1>

  <p>So I have this problem with a virtual dev box that when I suspend the machine and then un-suspend it again the system time will be wrong. The hardware clock is obviously still right (as it is controlled and thus adjusted by the VM host).</p>
<p>This is not a huge problem as you can simply resync the system clock using the hwclock. This is quite easy and can be done with this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>hwclock --hctosys
</pre></div>
<p>The problem is just that I don.t want to do this manually every time I login. So I thought I would just add it to my .bash_profile/.bashrc/.*rc and then have it sync the clock everytime I login.</p>
<p><em>Note: the first thought was to resync it on a restart, but because I just suspend the guest it is hardly ever restarted.</em></p>
<p>Now the problem was that the hwclock program must be run as the superuser. So how can I run a script as the superuser without having to login as the superuser every time?</p>
<p>Well it.s not too hard. Simply add the following line to the sudoers file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ost <span class="nv">ALL</span><span class="o">=(</span>ALL<span class="o">)</span> NOPASSWD: /home/ost/bin/sync_clock
</pre></div>
<p>This allows you to run this application as root without having to enter the password. You can try it by running it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>sudo ./bin/sync_clock
</pre></div>
<p>It should not ask you for a password now (note that if you must still prepend the command with <strong>sudo</strong>).</p>
<p><em>Note: sync_clock is a simple bash script that runs the hwclock sync application and is called from .bash_profile or .bashrc (depending on your system, I have it in .bashrc on arch).</em></p>
